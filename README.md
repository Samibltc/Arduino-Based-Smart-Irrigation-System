# Arduino-Based-Smart-Irrigation-System
This Arduino project implements an Automated Irrigation System using soil moisture and water level sensors. The system continuously monitors soil moisture and water level, displaying the percentage values on a 16x2 LCD. It features manual irrigation control with a button and automatic irrigation based on predefined soil moisture thresholds.
