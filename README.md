# Arduino-Based-Smart-Irrigation-System
This Arduino project implements an Automated Irrigation System using soil moisture and water level sensors. The system continuously monitors soil moisture and water level, displaying the percentage values on a 16x2 LCD. It features manual irrigation control with a button and automatic irrigation based on predefined soil moisture thresholds.

This Arduino project implements an Automated Irrigation System using soil moisture and water level sensors. The system continuously monitors soil moisture and water level, displaying the percentage values on a 16x2 LCD. It features manual irrigation control with a button and automatic irrigation based on predefined soil moisture thresholds.

The project utilizes components such as a soil moisture sensor, ultrasonic sensor for water level measurement, 16x2 LCD, LED, relay for water pump control, buzzer, and a push button.

The pin configuration for various components is specified in the code. The LCD is connected to pins 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4. The soil moisture sensor, LED, relay, and buzzer have their respective pins defined in the code. The ultrasonic sensor is connected to pins 11 and 10, while the push button is connected to pin 13.

The system provides real-time display of soil moisture and water level percentages on the LCD. Manual irrigation control is achieved by pressing the button, and automatic irrigation is triggered based on predefined soil moisture thresholds. The buzzer alerts users in case of low water levels.

To use the system, connect the sensors and components as per the defined pin configuration, upload the provided Arduino sketch to your board, and monitor soil moisture and water level percentages on the LCD. Press the button for manual irrigation when needed, and enjoy an automated irrigation system based on soil moisture thresholds.

Feel free to contribute, enhance, or customize the code to meet your specific needs. Ensure proper calibration of sensors for accurate readings. Happy gardening! ðŸŒ±ðŸš¿
